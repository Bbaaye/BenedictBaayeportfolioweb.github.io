									<h1>Welcome to my course and Certificates section<br />
									<h4>										
										I have completed a range of programming and machine learning courses across reputable platforms, equipping me with versatile, in-demand technical skills. From LinkedIn, I took Python and JavaScript courses, which taught me the fundamentals of these popular languages and gave me hands-on experience in web development and data manipulation. I also studied machine learning on MATLAB’s Onramp course, where I learned to build and evaluate predictive models using data preprocessing and supervised learning techniques. On Udemy, I delved into Dart and Flutter to develop cross-platform mobile applications and took a comprehensive C++ course that strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming and memory management.
										
										These courses not only broadened my knowledge across programming languages and frameworks but also refined my problem-solving abilities, project management skills, and confidence in applying these technologies to real-world scenarios.</h4>
